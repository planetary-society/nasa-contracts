== NASA Contracts Data and Parser ==

The ruby script downloads and summarizes contract information from NASA's Data Procurement View (NPDV) system, over a range of fiscal years, and writes them to a variety of tab-delimited files.

The raw data is appended with two additional columns: State and District (congressional district) where possible.

The summary files list all the number of unique contract recipients and total obligations (in $) by state. It also breaks out statistics for both number
of recipients and dollars obligated by several standard categories: small business, minority-owned businesses, woman-owned businesses, educational institutions, public universities, and historically black colleges or universities (HBCUs).
Note that a single recipient may appear in multiple categories.
